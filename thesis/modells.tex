For determining whether probands were blinded, one dimensional and two dimensional convolutional neural networks were utilized. One dimensional convolutional neural networks have become popular for time series classifications \todo{ref}. Two dimensional coovolutinal neural networks are mostly used for image processing. However, a possibility is to create synthetic images from the data and use these images in a two dimensional convolutional network.
